trying to use UWMadison data...

+===== status as of 24-Sept-2023 =================
forked the repo and the code looks really really nice.
Unable, however to make sense of the LONDI dataset...  trying to run unet_train_2d and it's looking for data/datasets/train_inputs_120.csv'
But who really cares - I'm not interested in the LONDI dataset, rather I want to target the UWMadison GI Tract data....
so recommendation is to pursue that direction....
